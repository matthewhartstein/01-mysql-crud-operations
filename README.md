SQL Database Operations Demo

Programming Language: SQL

Libraries/Frameworks: None (standard SQL, likely for a relational database like MySQL or MariaDB)

Description: This SQL script demonstrates basic database operations (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a users table in a database called test_db. It starts by resetting the database (dropping and recreating test_db), then creates a users table with columns for id (auto-incremented primary key), name, email (unique), and created_at (timestamp). The script inserts three sample users, reads all records, updates one user's email, deletes another user, and counts the remaining users. Finally, it adds two more users and displays the updated table. This showcases fundamental SQL operations for managing a simple database.
